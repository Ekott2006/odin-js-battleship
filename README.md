# Project: Battleship

This project tackles building the classic Battleship game using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. We'll leverage JavaScript and a popular testing framework, Jest, to write unit tests that guide the development process.

## Inspiration

The [Odin Project's curriculum on Battleship Game](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-battleship) serves as the foundation for this project.

## Technologies

- JavaScript

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Jest (testing framework)
- Git (version control)
- GitHub (collaboration platform) (Optional)

## Outcomes

- **Mastering TDD with Battleship:** Experience the power of TDD by building a real-world game with tests driving the development.
- **Robust Game Logic:**  Implement unit tests using Jest to ensure the core game functionalities like board creation, ship placement, attack resolution, and win/loss conditions are rock-solid.
- **Modular and Maintainable Code:**  Structure the code with TDD, leading to well-defined functions and easier maintenance.
- **Effective Version Control (Optional):** Utilize Git for version management, allowing you to track changes and revert to earlier versions if needed.
- **GitHub Integration (Optional):** Leverage GitHub for storing code, managing versions, and potentially deploying the game (if desired).

## Key Learnings

- **Benefits of TDD in Games:**
  - **Improved Game Logic:** TDD helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, leading to a more polished and bug-free game.
  - **Simplified Maintenance:** Well-tested code with clear functions is easier to understand and modify in the future.
  - **Increased Confidence:** Unit tests provide a safety net, giving developers confidence that their code works as intended.
